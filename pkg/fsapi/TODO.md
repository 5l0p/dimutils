# Filesystem API for Kafka Package TODO

## Core Filesystem Interface
- [ ] POSIX-like filesystem interface for Kafka topics and partitions
- [ ] Directory structure mapping (clusters/topics/partitions)
- [ ] File-like operations (read, write, seek, stat) on message streams
- [ ] Virtual filesystem mounting and unmounting
- [ ] Path-based navigation and discovery
- [ ] Metadata file representation for topic/partition info

## Kafka Topic Operations
- [ ] Topic listing as directory contents
- [ ] Topic creation and deletion through filesystem operations
- [ ] Topic configuration as file properties
- [ ] Partition representation as subdirectories or files
- [ ] Message reading through file read operations
- [ ] Message writing through file append operations

## Message Stream Interface
- [ ] Sequential message reading with offset tracking
- [ ] Random access to messages by offset
- [ ] Message range queries and filtering
- [ ] Stream seeking to specific timestamps or offsets
- [ ] Message batching for efficient I/O operations
- [ ] Stream buffering and caching mechanisms

## FUSE Filesystem Integration
- [ ] FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) implementation
- [ ] Mount Kafka clusters as local directories
- [ ] Standard filesystem tools compatibility (ls, cat, grep)

- [ ] Filesystem notifications for topic/partition changes

## Integration with External Tools
- [ ] kcat integration for enhanced Kafka operations

- [ ] IDE integration for Kafka development workflows

## libsql(lite) Integration
- [ ] SQLite database interface for Kafka metadata
- [ ] Message indexing and searchability through SQL
- [ ] Topic schema storage and querying
- [ ] Message content indexing for full-text search

- [ ] Custom SQL functions for Kafka-specific operations

## Virtual File Types
- [ ] Topic metadata files (schema, configuration, statistics)
- [ ] Partition info files (offset ranges, segment details)
- [ ] Consumer group status files
- [ ] Producer configuration files
- [ ] Schema registry files and references
- [ ] Administrative operation logs

## Performance and Caching
- [ ] Intelligent caching of frequently accessed messages
- [ ] Lazy loading of large message streams

- [ ] Custom indexing strategies and optimizations

## Configuration and Management
- [ ] Filesystem mount configuration and profiles
- [ ] Multi-cluster support and switching
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Dynamic configuration updates and reload
